# Hash
Hash is a little tool which compares hashes of text inputs in MD5, SHA1, SHA256 and SHA512. It is not advised to use this in a professional manner, because it was not developed professionally.

This repository is merely a school project I've done in order to advance my skills in C#.

##Binary
Since this is a Visual Studio project, the binary file can be found in /Hash/bin/Debug/Hash.exe.
